# blog
simple blog site using ruby on rails.
You must be running a server to view the code, this was a very simple project form a web application course.
The goal was to create any website that you wanted that allowed users to create a "post" and allow "comments" to 
be made to those posts.

This app uses the standard MVC design method and is organized as such.  Begin viewing code in the apps directory and
navigate from there.
